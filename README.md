## Building from source

### GNOME Builder (Recommended)
GNOME Builder is the environment used for developing this application. It can use Flatpak manifests to create a consistent building and running environment cross-distro. Thus, it is highly recommended you use it.

1. Download [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Builder).
2. In Builder, click the "Clone Repository" button at the bottom, using `https://github.com/SeaDve/Kooha.git` as the URL.
3. Click the build button at the top once the project is loaded.


### Manual
```
git clone https://github.com/SeaDve/Kooha.git
cd Kooha
mkdir -p $HOME/Projects/flatpak/repo
flatpak-builder --repo=$HOME/Projects/flatpak/repo --force-clean --ccache build-dir io.github.seadve.Kooha.json
flatpak remote-add --no-gpg-verify local-repo $HOME/Projects/flatpak/repo
flatpak install local-repo io.github.seadve.Kooha
